# An OCaml Module for Optimal Line Breaking 

This repository implements a module `Linebreak` that provides
breaking a list of words into a list of lines, each not exceeding 
a given width. 

The `Linebreak` module is accompanied by a small client application `demo`
for tests and experiments. Module `Linebreak` implements two algorithms,
_simple_ and _smart_. The simple algorithm implements the naive greedy
algorithm of appending a word to a line as long as enough space is
available. The smart algorithm distributes unused space at the end of lines
over all lines in a paragraph in an optimal way using a cost model: unused
space at the end of a line is attributed a cost that is the square of the
number of spaces not used. This cost is summed up over all lines and
minimized. Hence, the algorithm finds the line breaking that causes the
smallest cost.

Below are two paragraphs. The left one was formatted using the simple
algorithm and the right one the smart algorithm. The cost indicates
that the smart formatting distributes the unused space more evenly.

The demo client can be used to compare the two algorithms by
taking a line from a file and formatting it for a short line width:

## Building

The source code is a literate program. You need Lipsum
(https://github.com/lindig/lipsum.git) to extract the source code. (Lipsum
is implemented in Objective Caml and should be no problem to build.)

With Lipsum installed, just call Make, which in turn relies on OCamlBuild.

    $ make

For use in your own project, you either can use `linebreak.{ml,mli}`
directly or take `format.lp` and use Lipsum to extract `linebreak.{ml,mli}`
when you need it.

## Running

You can run the demo client for some help. A _width_ needs to be a positive
integer denoting the desired line width in characters.


    ./demo.native( -copyright | -help | <alg> [options] )

    -copyright       prints the copyright notice
    -help            prints this help

    <alg> is one of:
     -g width        simple line breaking
     -s width        smart line breaking
     -x width        compare simple and smart
     -d width        emit debug information
    <option> is one of:
     -f file         read input from file instead of stdin
     -atomic         treat input as one paragraph instead of each line

## References

Breaking words into lines as it is implemented in TeX is discussed in _The
TeXbook_ by Donald Knuth in Chapter 14 _How TEX Breaks Paragraphs into
Lines_. 

The algorithm implemented in `Linebreak` is considerably simpler than the
TeX algorithm but works on the same principles. In particular, `Linebreak`
computes the cost between any two adjacent points while the algorithm in
TeX is optimized for longer lines and checks only likely breakpoints.

Oege de Moor and Jeremy Gibbons from Oxford University discuss in _Bridging
the Algorithm Gap: A Linear-time Functional Program for Paragraph
Formatting_ the problem and present a linear algorithm for optimal line
breaking. As an introduction, a classical non-linear algorithm is presented
as well. The presentation is broken down into very small functions and
remarkable for that. I am not sure how their naive implementation compares
with my implementation here.

## Future Work

The `Linebreak` module could be generalized to permit any value to be
assembled into lines. This would require to turn it into a functor. 
For now I don't need this.

A more likely addition is to make the last line in a paragraph special in
that unused space here does not count towards the total cost. I haven't yet
thought about how to implement this.

## Overview

We have interface and implementation of the `Linebreak` module 
and a command line client. Module `Linebreaking` implements two
algorithms which stay in separate sub modules.

The cost model assumes that words in a line are separated
by spaces of width one and that each character in a word is
likewise of width one.

### Main

The main function resides in module `Demo`. It has no interface since it
is the top-level module that executes `main`.

    <<demo.ml>>=
    exception Error of string
    let error fmt   = Printf.kprintf (fun msg -> raise (Error msg)) fmt
    
    let length          = String.length
    let square (x:int)  = x * x
    let (@@) f x        = f x
    let eprintf         = Printf.eprintf
    let printf          = Printf.printf
    
    <<Demo>>
    
    let () = if !Sys.interactive then () else 
        try
            main (Array.to_list Sys.argv); exit 0
        with
        | Error(msg)         -> eprintf "error: %s\n" msg; exit 1
        | Sys_error(msg)     -> eprintf "error: %s\n" msg; exit 1
    

### Scanner

The demo client employs a scanner to break a text file into words. This
might be useful in the long run when we want to categorize words into
different categories or implement unbreakable spaces.

    <<scanner.mll>>=
    {
        <<prelude>>
    }
    <<rules>>
    
    {
    let words lexbuf = scan [] lexbuf
    let lines lexbuf = lines [] [] lexbuf
    }
    

## Linebreaking Implementation

    <<global definitions>>=
    let (@@) f x    = f x
    
    
The line breaking algorithm breaks `words` into lines represented as a 
list of words.

    <<global definitions>>=
    type words  = string list 
    type lines  = words list
    
    let length = String.length
    let spacewidth = 1 (* width of a space *)
    let square (x:int): int = x*x
    

## Demo Client

`finally f x cleanup` function provides resource cleanup in the presence
of exceptions: `f x` is computed as a result and `cleanup x` is guaranteed
to run afterwards. (In many cases `cleanup` will not use its argument `x`
but it can be convenient to have access to it.)

    <<Demo>>=
    type 'a result = Success of 'a | Failed of exn
    let finally f x cleanup = 
        let result = try Success (f x) with exn -> Failed exn
        in
            cleanup x; 
            match result with
            | Success y  -> y 
            | Failed exn -> raise exn
    
    
`process f path` opens file `path` or `stdin` when no path is provided
and creates a `lexbuf` from it, which is passed to `f`. `process` takes
care of opening and closing the file such that `f` does not need to do it.

    <<Demo>>=
    let process f = function
        | Some path -> 
            let io = open_in path in
            let lexbuf = Lexing.from_channel io in
                finally f lexbuf (fun _ -> close_in io)
        | None      -> 
            let lexbuf = Lexing.from_channel stdin in
                f lexbuf
    
    
    
`a2i` converts a string of a non-negative integer into an integer value.
    <<Demo>>=
    let a2i str =
        try 
            let n = int_of_string str in
                if n >= 0 
                then n 
                else error "\"%s\" must be a positive number" str
        with 
            Failure _ -> error "\"%s\" must be positive number" str
    
    
    <<Demo>>=
    let badness (width:int) (lines:Linebreak.lines): int =
        let sum f = List.fold_left (fun sum x -> sum + f x) 0 in
        let cost (words:string list): int =
            let spaces = max 0 (List.length words - 1) in
            let chars  = sum length words in
            let total  = chars + spaces in
                square (width - total)
        in
            sum cost lines
    
    
`padright w str` returns string `str` padded with spaces on the right
such that is has length `w`. It returns `str` as is if it is longer than
`w` already.

    <<Demo>>=
    let padright width string =
        let n = String.length string in
        if n < width then
            string ^ String.make (width - n) '_'
        else
            string
    
    
    <<Demo>>=
    let print (width:int) (lines:Linebreak.lines): unit =
         ( List.iter  (fun s -> Printf.printf "|%s|\n" (padright width s))
            @@ List.map (String.concat " ") lines
         ; Printf.printf "cost: %d\n" (badness width lines)
         )
    
    
    <<Demo>>=
    let print' width (lines:Linebreak.lines): unit =
        Printf.printf "%3d|%s|\n" 
            (badness width lines) 
                (String.concat "|" 
                @@ List.map (padright width)
                @@ List.map (String.concat " ") lines)
    

The `main` function parses the command line. Exceptions are caught and
reported one level up.

## Smart Line Breaking

Optimal line breaking takes a list of words and breaks it into lines by
minimizing the amount of unused space at the end of each line. The solution
is optimal in the sense that no better line breaking exists given the
chosen cost model: for each line, the number of unused spaces at the end of
the line is taken and this number is squared and summed up for the
resulting paragraph.  Squaring the unused spaces penalizes lines with many
unused spaces more than those with fewer and leads to a distribution of the
unused space across all lines.

The line breaking algorithm maintains for each possible break point
(between two adjacent lines) three information:

1. The word before the break point.
2. The optimal cost for breaking up the paragraph provided it
   ends after the word.
3. The number of words that also belong to the current line.

The number of words that in addition to the current word belong to the
current line provides a way to construct all break points backwards from
last word of a paragraph.

The line breaking algorithm maintains a paragraph `par` as a list of
triples.  It represents all words in a paragraph together with the
associated costs. The list is maintained such that words later in
a paragraph appear at the beginning of the list.

    <<Smart>>=
    type cost       =   int
    type break      =   string * cost * int
    type par        =   break list
    
    
    <<Smart>>=
    let dump (par:par):unit =
        let break (word, cost, skip) = 
            Printf.printf "%4d %+2d %2d %s\n" cost skip (length word) word
        in
            List.iter break @@ List.rev par
    
    
`minimal par` provides the best cost for paragraph `par`. 
(This is mostly needed for the special case where `par` is empty.)

    <<Smart>>=
    let minimum: par -> cost = function
        | []            -> 0
        | (_,cost,_)::_ -> cost
    
    
`add'` is an internal function. It adds `word` to paragraph `par` 
and returns a `par` value with `word` added (and the resulting cost). This 
function scans `par` to determine how many words should be on the same
line as `word` to minimize the cost should the paragraph end with `word`.

The `add'` function knows that
1. `avail` space is available and
2. the best solution so far results in cost `cost` and would keep
   `skip` words on the same line as `word`. 

Searching for a better solution stops when the available space is too small
for the next word that we could add. At this point we return the best
solution found so far. We also stop at the beginning of the paragraph when
no words to try remain.

    <<Smart>>=
    let rec add' (word:string) (avail:int) (n:int) cost skip par =
        (* let spacewidth = 1 in  debug *)
        let need w = length w + spacewidth in (* need room for word + space *)
        match par with
        | []                             -> word, cost, skip (* best so far *)
        | (w,c,s)::par when need w > avail -> word, cost, skip (* best so far *)
        | (w,c,s)::par ->
            let cost'   = square (avail - need w) + minimum par in
            let skip'   = n+1 in
            let avail'  = avail - need w in
                if cost' < cost (* better breakpoint found? *)
                then add' word avail' skip' cost' skip' par 
                else add' word avail' skip' cost  skip  par 
    
    
`add_word` adds another word to a paragraph `par`. For the initial best
cost we assume that the word sits on a line by itself, the rest of the line
is unused and we use the breakpoint preceding `word`. The cost for this
breakpoint is `minumum par`. From this situation we try to find a better
solution by adding more (existing) words to the line. Searching for this
better solution is done by `add'`.

    <<Smart>>=
    let add_word (word:string) (linewidth:int) (par:par): break =

`doc` converts a paragraph value into a `lines` value. It walks through
the paragraph and collects words into lines starting from the last word in 
the paragraph. Since this includes the number of words that belong to the
same line, function `doc` can take it from there.

    <<Smart>>=
    let doc (par:par): lines =
        let rec loop n par words lines = match n, par with
            | _, []         -> words::lines
            | 0, (w,c,n)::p -> loop n p [w] (words::lines)
            | n, (w,c,_)::p -> loop (n-1) p (w::words) lines
        in match par with
        | []         -> []
        | (w,c,n)::p -> loop n p [w] []
    
  


`break'` takes a list of words and adds them one by one to create
a paragraph of type `par`.

    <<Smart>>=
    let break' (linewidth:int) (words:words): par = 
        let rec loop paragraph = function
        | []            -> paragraph
        | word :: words -> 
            loop (add_word word linewidth paragraph :: paragraph) words
        in
            loop [] words
    
    
    <<Smart>>=
    let break linewidth words = doc @@ break' linewidth words
    let debug linewidth words = dump @@ break' linewidth words
    

## Simple line breaking

`break` implements a simple line breaking algorithm that takes a list of
words and breaks it into lines (each represented as a list words) no longer
than `width` characters. The algorithm fills a line with words until the
next word no longer fits into the given `width`. A word longer than `width`
characters ends up on a line by its own.

After a word is added to a line, the remaining space equals the available
space `w` minus the length of the word that was added and minus one space
since the next word (if any) would need that space as a separator.

    <<Simple>>=
    let break (width:int) (words:words): lines =
        let len   = String.length in
        let rev   = List.rev in
        let rec loop w lines words = match lines, words with
            | line::lines, word::words when len word <= w -> 
                loop (w - len word - spacewidth) ((word::line)::lines) words
            | line::lines, word::words  -> 
                loop (width - len word - spacewidth) 
                        ([word] :: rev line :: lines) words
            | line::lines,[]  -> rev (rev line :: lines)
            | [], words -> loop w [[]] words
        in
            loop width [] words
    


## Scanner

The prelude contains definitions that we can use in the semantic action 
of a rule.

    <<prelude>>=
    exception Error of string
    let error fmt = Printf.kprintf (fun msg -> raise (Error msg)) fmt
    
    let (@@) f x    = f x
    let get         = Lexing.lexeme (* matched string *)
    
    
    
Rule `words`  splits the input into words by capturing
sequences of non-whitespace characters. Such words are collected into
a list.  This list must be reversed before it is returned. 

    <<rules>>=
    rule scan words = parse
         eof                        { List.rev words }
      |  [^ ' ' '\n' '\r' '\t']+    { scan (get lexbuf :: words) lexbuf }
      |  _                          { scan words lexbuf }  (* skip *)   
    
    
Rule `lines` scans a file line by line and splits each line into a list
of words. The resulting value has type `(string list) list`.

    <<rules>>=
    and lines words ls = parse
          eof                       { List.rev (List.rev words :: ls) }
      |  [^ ' ' '\n' '\r' '\t']+    { lines (get lexbuf :: words) ls  lexbuf}
      |  '\r'* '\n'                 { lines [] (List.rev words :: ls) lexbuf}
      |  _                          { lines words ls lexbuf } (* skip *)
